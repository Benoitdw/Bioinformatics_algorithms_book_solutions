# ðŸ‘‹ Hi <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

I am learning Rust while I am following the wonderfull [Bioinformatics Algorithms book](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/). I create this page to publish my solutions and also keep a trace of my learning progress. Feel free to give me any advices to help me write better code by contacting and also have a look to the problems resolution, I would be happy if I can help one of us.

 ## Progress <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
 
 - Chapter 1
   - [âœ… Compute the Number of Times a Pattern Appears in a Text](/Chapter_1/BA1A)
   - ... 

That's all? 
Yes bro, I just create this page and I will update it later, Most of the algorithms implementations are already done for the chapter 1 but I want to take the time to correctly explain all of it in order to writte in indelible form in my brain how they work.
